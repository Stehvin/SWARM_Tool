# SWARM Tool
The SWARM Tool is a tool used to help optimize equipment usage in a shop. My task was to automate this tool, so it would level-load 
the shop equipment more optimally than a person could accomplish manually.

I am using this repository mainly for storage, so I don't plan to change the files, except maybe to improve their readability.
